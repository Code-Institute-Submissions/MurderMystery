            <p>Addy has never forgiven Holly.</p>
            <p>It seems that what happened to Addy's dog has now happened to Holly's dog</p>
            <p>Could be revenge.</p>
            <p>When questioned on her where abouts during the crime, she claims to be in her flat.</p>
            <p>There is no one to confirm Addy's alibi.</p>

            <p>Jim is Holly's husband.</p>
            <p>Holly's friends have let us know that she planned to tell Jim everything about the affair she was having.</p>
            <p>From what witnesses it seems Jim didn't take the new well.</p>
            <p>He was the last person to have seen Holly according to witnesses.</p>
            <p>Lastly he was caught running from the flat in angery state going towards his car.</p>
            <p>When questioned where he had went Jim claims he went to his Mothers house to think things through.</p>
            <p>His Mother confirms this saying he arrived at 23:00.</p>
            <p>This is strange as it only takes 20 minutes to get there.</p>
            <p>This gives him the time to go back quietly and kill Holly before getting to his Mother's</p>
            <p>Jim also owns a pocket knife that matches the size of the wound but, claims to have lost it.</p>
            <p>This pocket knife is fairly common.</p>

            <p>Glen lives in the same building as Holly and Jim.</p>
            <p>The Neighbours who know him claim that he had fallen for Holly and it wasn't just an affair for him.</p>
            <p>The Neighbours are unsure if Holly had told Glen that she was coming clean to Jim.</p>
            <p>Niamh Drew did mention that he did seem a bit off when she saw him in the morning.</p>
            <p>Glen claims that during the crime he was heading home from work.</p>
            <p>When checking out Glen's alibi his work claims that he left at 21:30.</p>
            <p>This gives him enough time to get to Holly's to commit the crime.</p>
