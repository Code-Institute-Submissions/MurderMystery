Testing
-
The testing process I went through is listed below:
- Testing user stories.
- Validating the code.
- Checking if the website is repsonsive.
- Manually testing the websites features.

Testing user stories
-
New users :
- The first new user wanted a free out let that would be able to give them the experience of trying to solve a murder and that is exactly what I gave them.
- The second new user wanted to test if they were clever enough to be able to solve a murder themselves. I made a murder story that was difficult but not too difficult which I think provides exactly what they are looking for.

Returning user:

- The returning user wants to be able to come back to the website and have a look at the details to see if they missed anything. All the information will be presented as usual so they are able to do so.

Tablet user:

- The tablet user wanted to be able to use the website on their tablet and I have made a repsonsive working website that works on the tabelet or phone.

Validating my code
-
HTML
-
To validate my code I used: https://validator.w3.org/

Index.html errors:
- There was no errors.

Homepage.html errors:
- There was no closing tag for one of the P elements so added the end tag to fix it.
- No other errors.

Suspects.html errors:

Convict.html errors:

CSS
-
To validate my code I used: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

style.css errors:
- No errors just warnings about the "-webkit-background-size: cover;" styling being unrecongised.

JavaScript
-
To validate my code I used: https://jshint.com/

Evidence-script.js
- 46 Missing semicolon. Fixed

Convict-script.js
- There were no errors.

Contact-script.js
- There were no errors.

Suspect-script.js
- There were no errors.

Witness-script.js
- There were no errors.

Manually testing the website features
-
- I went through each of the buttons in the task bar from each page to make sure they worked.
- I went to each button on the Evidence, Suspects and Witness pages and made sure that they all closed and opened correctly.
- On the evidence page I made sure the if statement worked by putting the code in correctly and incorrectly.
- For the convict page I made sure that the if statement worked by putting in all the options to see if the correct text and button would come up for all of them. Doing this help me discover that since I had renamed one of the files the button no longer worked so that had to be adjusted.
- On the contact to test that the contact form I made sure that I sent my self a few emails with different input.
